        <div class="lyrics-content">
        90 years ago there was a doctor called freud
he had this patient, this little guy named lloyd.
all lloyd thought about was just getting laid.
he tried to get a sheila, he even tried his maid
searching for some action, he was looking out for fun
searching for some loving, still he just couldn't get noone
some gals were black some gals were white
some gals were heavy some not too bright
he just didn't care, he just wanted all
he would do anything, he would even crawl
in his desperation, he called dr. sigmund freud
said: help me doctor, help poor horny lloyd
dr. freud said:
sex is gut, und sex is fine
but sex all the time, nein nein nein!
sex is gut, und sex is fine
but sex all the time, nein nein nein nein nein!
so lloyd just kept on searching down life's lonely road
for that special gal who'd help him with his load
someone he could lean on, someone he could love
someone he could finally call his own
till he met mary who finally made him see
there's more to life baby than just the birds and the bees
so now things have changed lloyd has found his way
to love and marry a little baby way
now that lloyd is happy, the good doctor's dead
you could still tell there's someone on his head
sometimes he remembers what that dr. said
now he's sure that freud was crazy and out of his head
cause he knows that:
sex is gut, und sex all the way
sex all the time, yeah yeah yeah!
sex is gut, und sex all the way
sex all the time, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!
he remembers how things were, and what the doctor said
he thought the man was crazy and way out of his head
sex is good, und sex all the way
sex all the time, yeah yeah yeah
sex is gut, und sex is fine
sex all the time, it blows my mind -3
sex is good and sex is fine
sex all the time, it blows my mind
sex is good, und sex all the way
sex all the time, yeah yeah yeah
sex is good, und sex all the way
sex all the time, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah#
what is good for you
